# Project:
An online video company asked for an analysis of the courses and videos of the platform, from a sample of the database. We will look at the average time students take to complete their classes, which courses and which videos of each are the most accessed.
It will be correlation analysis, checking if the popularity of the course is related to its average duration. We will import databases and gather external information that we need to have in one place to do the analysis.


## Popularity Analysis:
We created a statistically rigorous chart with scale and checkered background that assists in statistical inferences. For example, on the vertical axis we have 500, and two squares above we have 1000. From the square we know that 750 is right in the middle of them, shaded area is the margin of confidence, in which we hope the points are distributed. It acts as a measure of error of the curve, so for safety, in addition to the blue line, consider the shaded area in gray. It indicates the region in which you expect to find values. The correct interpretation includes the values of the shaded area, the margin of error.
